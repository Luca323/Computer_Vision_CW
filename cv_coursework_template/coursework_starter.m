%% ================= TASK 1 =================
% You need to write extractTinyImages which is provided as obscured p-code so that you can run the code and see an example results including confusion matrix and image gallery generated.
% You should consider passing more relevant parameters to this function, e.g. 'rgb' or 'grayscale', type of normalisation, type of cropping etc.
%
% Also you need to write trainKNN function which is also provided as obscured p-code
% As above you should consider passing more relevant parameters to this function, e.g. 'k' and 'distance metric'. You should define them in your config file.

% trainKNN
% You can use fitcknn here. You should not use OptimizeHyperparameters option which needs to be disabled 
% i.e. you need to perform fine-tuning of your k distance metric and standardisation parameters manually i.e. 
% you should not enable OptimizeHyperparameters (keep it disabled as it is by default).
% Your fine-tuning should be done using cross-validation on a training set part of the dataset.
% Of course, you need to test your fine-tune model on the test set part of the dataset using the Matlab built in predict function.

% trainSVM
% You can use fitcsvm here designed for binary classification. 
% You should train a linear linear SVM for every category (i.e. one vs all)
% and then use the learned linear classifiers to predict the category of
% every test image. Every test feature will be evaluated with all 15 SVMs
% and the most confident SVM will "win". Confidence, or distance from the
% margin, is W*X + B where '*' is the inner product or dot product and W and
% B are the learned hyperplane parameters. 
% You should not use OptimizeHyperparameters option which needs to remain disabled 
% i.e. you need to perform optimisation of your BoxConstraint manually.

% Furthermore, you may notice that this can be also performed in a more automatic way 
% using fitecoc which was designed for multiple class problems. 
% However, you should not use this one or any similar function. 
% That is please write your code and perform fine-tuning for binary one-vs-all linear SVM 
% using fitcsvm with OptimizeHyperparameters switched off.
% The fine-tuning should be done using cross-validation on the training set part of the dataset.
% Of course, you need to test your fine-tune model on the test set part of the dataset.

% You shoud use this approach in all places in your coursework where you use SVM.

%% ================= TASK 3 =================
% As in previous tasks you need to implement bovw_buildVocab and bovw_encode functions. You can use trainSVM developed for Task 2.
% As above you should include more parameters that you will need to define in config. 
% Remember you need to perform BoxConstraint fine tuning for SVM.

% function bovw_buildVocab
% 'vocab' should be C.bovw.numWords x 64 (for SURF features). Each row is a cluster centroid / visual word.
% Load images from the training set. To save computation time, you don't
% necessarily need to sample from all training images, although it would be better
% to do so. You can simply create a coarse with a large step size here, but a smaller step size in bovw_encode. 
% Once you have tens of thousands of SIFT features from many training
% images, cluster them with kmeans. The resulting centroids are now your
% visual word vocabulary.

% function bovw_encode
% This function assumes that vocab exists and is an N x 64
% matrix where each row is a kmeans centroid or a visual word. This
% matrix is saved to disk rather than passed in a parameter to avoid
% recomputing the vocabulary every time at significant expense.
% Xtr3 and Xte3 are an both 1500 x C.bovw.numWords matrix and 
% they can be also saved to disk to save subsequent recomputations.
% You will want to construct SURF features here in the same way you
% did in bovw_buildVocab (except for possibly changing the sampling
% rate) and then assign each local feature to its nearest cluster center
% and build a histogram indicating how many times each cluster was used.
% Don't forget to normalize the histogram, or else a larger image with more
% SURF features will look very different from a smaller version of the same
% image.
